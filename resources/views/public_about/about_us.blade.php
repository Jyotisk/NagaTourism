                        The Department of Tourism came into being as a fully fledged Directorate of Tourism about three decades back in 1981. The reason for establishing a separate Directorate was to focus on the development of Tourism in the state in the first two decades of its existence, the department, however could not take off on its own due to many problems and restrictions, such as, lack of adequate infrastructural facilities and travel restrictions to the state. However, with the lifting of the Protected Area Permit (PAP) by the Home Ministry, Government of India in the last two years which has been again extended for another year, the number of tourist have started showing remarkable increase. The issue of Inner Line Permi (ILP) for domestic tourists has been also made more convenient by issuing them in Nagaland Houses outside the State.

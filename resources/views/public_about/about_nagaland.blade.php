                    <p class="main-text">Nagaland, with its rich cultural heritage and scintillating landscapes, is any traveler’s delight. Old Naga traditional homes have this legacy of storytelling where many of our folktales, folksongs, and stories of our rich culture and tradition have been passed on, from generation to generation.</p>
                    <p class="main-text">Our forefathers tilled the land in picturesque terrace fields, overlooking pristine mountains and faraway blue skies. They “hi-hoyed” while working in the fields, in groups or alone; when they sowed paddy on terrace fields; when they harvested them or carried them home in beautifully woven baskets; when they celebrated their numerous festivals or even mourned the death of a loved one.</p>
                    <p class="main-text">There still lives a piece of culture in every Naga traditional home and with rich stories etched in every historical place, Nagaland is a paradise unexplored in every sense of the word. It is also popularly known as the ‘land of festivals and every tribal festival is celebrated with pomp and gaiety, adorned with rich and colorful traditional attires.</p>
                    <p class="main-text">The most vibrant being the ‘Hornbill Festival’ where the songs of the ancient Nagas echo and its music reverberates in the true spirit of the tribal men. Hornbill Festival, which is annually held from December 1-10 and aptly dubbed as the Festival of Festivals has proved to be one of the rarest kinds in the world.</p>
